# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# 📝 <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Are there ways to help reduce damages and lives taken due to natural disasters?

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# 📝 <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# What are ways to be prepared and have mitigation measures in place for different regions or countries. Also what is their effectiveness in minimizing disaster impacts?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# 📝 <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Charts or any type of grapth that can help show the information that can be used in the datasets.
# I believe their many types of ways to deal with a natural disaster and some mitigation actions may have different results.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# 📝 <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# FEMA Mitigation ideas and perpare - https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/fema-mitigation-ideas_02-13-2013.pdf
# I will be using this to have a better understanding of what ways there are to help perpare for a natural disaster and what to do if one does happen.
# 
# Hazard Mitigation Assistance Mitigated Properties - https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/hazard-mitigation-assistance-mitigated-properties-v3
# I will be using this dataset to help explain the ways to react to a natural disaster.
# 
# FEMA Web Declaration Areas - https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fema-web-declaration-areas-v1
# I will be using this dataset to help expand the dataset from above with dates of each disaster. I plan to use the disaster number found in this dataset to and the one above to join and connect the 2.
